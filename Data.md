# Section 2: Data

## Data Description

In this section, I will describe the data used to solve the problem as described previously. 

As noted below in the Further Development Section, it is possible to attempt quite complex and sophisticated scenarios when approaching this problem. However, given the size of the project and for simplicity only the following scenario will be addressed:

1. Query the FourSqaure website for the top sites in Chicago
2. Use the FourSquare API to get supplemental geographical data about the top sites
3. Use the FourSquare API to get top restaurent recommendations closest to each of the top site 
4. Use open source Chicago Crime data to provide the user with additional crime data

## Top Sites from FourSquare Website

Although FourSquare provides a comprehensive API, one of the things that API does not easily support is a mechanism to directly extract the top N sites / venues in a given city. This data, however, is easily available directly from the FourSquare Website. To do this simply go to www.foursquare.com, enter the city of your choise and select Top Picks from _I'm Looking For_ selection field.

Using BeautifulSoup and Requests the results of the Top Pick for Chicago was retrieved. A sample venue is shown below:

```html
<div class="venueDetails">
    <div class="venueName">
        <h2>
    <a href="/v/millennium-park/42b75880f964a52090251fe3" target="_blank">Millennium Park
    </a>
</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="venueMeta">
        <div class="venueScore positive" style="background-color: #00B551;" title="9.7/10 - People like this place">9.7</div>
        <div class="venueAddressData">
            <div class="venueAddress">201 E Randolph St (btwn Columbus Dr &amp; Michigan Ave), Chicago</div>
            <div class="venueData"><span class="venueDataItem"><span class="categoryName">Park</span><span class="delim"> â€¢ </span></span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

From this HTML the following data can be extracted:

* Venue Name
* Venue Score
* Venue Category 
* Venue HREF
* Venue ID [Extracted from the HREF]

A sample of the extracted data is given below:

| id                       | score | category      | name                         | href                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 42b75880f964a52090251fe3 | 9.7   | Park          | Millennium Park              | /v/millennium-park/42b75880f964a52090251fe3       |
| 4b9511c7f964a520f38d34e3 | 9.6   | Trail         | Chicago Lakefront Trail      | /v/chicago-lakefront-trail/4b9511c7f964a520f38... |
| 49e9ef74f964a52011661fe3 | 9.6   | Art Museum    | The Art Institute of Chicago | /v/the-art-institute-of-chicago/49e9ef74f964a5... |
| 4f2a0d0ae4b0837d0c4c2bc3 | 9.6   | Deli / Bodega | Publican Quality Meats       | /v/publican-quality-meats/4f2a0d0ae4b0837d0c4c... |
| 4aa05f40f964a520643f20e3 | 9.6   | Theater       | The Chicago Theatre          | /v/the-chicago-theatre/4aa05f40f964a520643f20e3   |

We will have a closer look at this data gather later on when the supplemental geographical data has been added.

## Supplemental Geographical Data

Using the `id` field extracted from the HTML it is then possible to get further supplemental geographical details about each of the top sites from FourSquare using the following sample API call:

```python
# Get the properly formatted address and the latitude and longitude
url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/{}?client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}'.format(
    venue_id, 
    cfg['client_id'],
    cfg['client_secret'],
    cfg['version'])
    
result = requests.get(url).json()
result['response']['venue']['location']
```
The requests returns a JSON object which can then be queried for the details required. The last line in the sample code above returns the following sample JSON:

```json
{  
   "city":"Chicago",
   "lng":-87.62323915831546,
   "crossStreet":"btwn Columbus Dr & Michigan Ave",
   "neighborhood":"The Loop",
   "postalCode":"60601",
   "cc":"US",
   "formattedAddress":[  
      "201 E Randolph St (btwn Columbus Dr & Michigan Ave)",
      "Chicago, IL 60601",
      "United States"
   ],
   "state":"IL",
   "address":"201 E Randolph St",
   "lat":41.8826616030636,
   "country":"United States"
}
```

From this the following attributes are extracted:

* Venue Address

* Venue Postalcode

* Venue City

* Venue Latitude

* Venue Longitude

   

## Final FourSquare Top Sites Data

A sample of the final FourSquare Top Sites data is shown below:

| id                       | score | category      | name                         | address                 | postalcode | city    | href                                              | latitude  | longitude  |
| ------------------------ | ----- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 42b75880f964a52090251fe3 | 9.7   | Park          | Millennium Park              | 201 E Randolph St       | 60601      | Chicago | /v/millennium-park/42b75880f964a52090251fe3       | 41.882662 | -87.623239 |

#### Data Analysis and Visualisation

An initial look at the data shows that there are 30 rows of data [as expected] each with 10 attributes. The variable types are all correct except the Venue Rating or Score which will be converted to a float. After converting the score column to a float it can clearly be seen that we have the top venues with a mean of `9.532`.

```python
df_top_venues.shape
(30, 10)

df_top_venues.dtypes
id             object
score          object
category       object
name           object
address        object
postalcode     object
city           object
href           object
latitude      float64
longitude     float64
dtype: object
    
df_top_venues.score.describe()
count    30.000000
mean      9.523333
std       0.072793
min       9.400000
25%       9.500000
50%       9.500000
75%       9.600000
max       9.700000
Name: score, dtype: float64
```



We are now ready to get the top restaurents within 500 meters of each of the top sites.

## FourSquare Restaurent Recommendation Data

Using the the list of all `id` values in the Top Sites DataFrame and the FourSquare `categoryID` that represents all food venues we now search for restaurants within a 500 meter radius.

```python
# Configure additional Search parameters
categoryId = '4d4b7105d754a06374d81259'
radius = 500
limit = 15

url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/search?client_id={}&client_secret={}&ll={},{}&v={}&categoryId={}&radius={}&limit={}'.format(
    cfg['client_id'],
    cfg['client_secret'],
    ven_lat,
    ven_long,
    cfg['version'],
    categoryId,
    radius,
    limit)

results = requests.get(url).json()
```
The requests returns a JSON object which can then be queried for the restaurant details required. A sample restaurnt from the results returned is shown below:

```json
{  
    "referralId":"v-1538424503",
    "hasPerk":"False",
    "venuePage":{  
        "id":"135548807"
    },
    "id":"55669b9b498ee34e5249ea61",
    "location":{  
        "labeledLatLngs":[  
            {  
                "label":"display",
                "lng":-87.62460021795313,
                "lat":41.88169538551873
            }
        ],
        "crossStreet":"btwn E Madison & E Monroe St",
        "postalCode":"60603",
        "formattedAddress":[  
            "12 S Michigan Ave (btwn E Madison & E Monroe St)",
            "Chicago, IL 60603",
            "United States"
        ],
        "distance":155,
        "city":"Chicago",
        "lng":-87.62460021795313,
        "neighborhood":"The Loop",
        "cc":"US",
        "state":"IL",
        "address":"12 S Michigan Ave",
        "lat":41.88169538551873,
        "country":"United States"
    },
    "name":"Cindy's",
    "categories":[  
        {  
            "pluralName":"Gastropubs",
            "id":"4bf58dd8d48988d155941735",
            "name":"Gastropub",
            "primary":"True",
            "icon":{  
                "prefix":"https://ss3.4sqi.net/img/categories_v2/food/gastropub_",
                "suffix":".png"
            },
            "shortName":"Gastropub"
        }
    ]
},
```
From this JSON the following attributes are extraced and added to the Dataframe:

- Restaurant ID
- Restaurant Category Name
- Restaurant Category ID
- Restaurant Nest_name
- Restaurant Address
- Restaurant Postalcode
- Restaurant City
- Restaurant Latitude
- Restaurant Longitude
- Venue Name
- Venue Latitude
- Venue Longitude

The only piece of data that is missing is the Score or Rating of the Restaurant. To get this we need to make another FourSquare API query using the id of the Restaurant:

```python
# Get the restaurant score and href
rest_url = 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/{}?client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}'.format(
    rest_id, 
    cfg['client_id'],
    cfg['client_secret'],
    cfg['version'])

result = requests.get(rest_url).json()
rest_score = result['response']['venue']['rating']
```
Using just the data in this DataFrame we will be able to generate maps displaying the chosen Top List Venue and the best scored surrounding restaurants. A sample of this data is shown below:

| id                       | score | category        | categoryID               | name                      | address           | postalcode | city    | latitude  | longitude  | venue_name      | venue_latitude | venue_longitude |
| ------------------------ | ----- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------- | --------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------- |

Looking at the data we get an interesting insight into the range of restuarants that are included. From a list of 30 top venues only 28 actually had more than 10 to provide the user with a real choice. In total there were 387 restaurants found of which 240 were unique occuring only once in the data. There were 72 categories of restaurants. The mean score of all the restaurants wa `8.23` with a manimum value of `9.5` and a minimum value of `5.3`.  

Coffee Shops (52) and Pizza Places (29) were the top two most frequently occurring categories but Pie Shops (9.4000) and French Restaurants (9.4000) were the restaurant categories with the highest average score.

This data was then processed as follows:

1. Move September 2017 dates to September 2018
   The extract of data used was taken mid September which meant that there was half a months data for September 2017 and half a months data for september 2018. These were combined to create a single month.
2. Clean up the column names:
   1. Strip leading & trailing whitespace
   2. Replace multiple spaces with a single space
   3. Remove # characters
   4. Replace spaces with _
   5. Convert to lowercase
3. Change the date of occurance field to a date / time object
4. Add new columns for:
   1. Hour
   2. Day
   3. Month
   4. Year
   5. etc.
5. Split Block into zip_code and street
6. Verify that all rows have valid data

#### Data Analysis and Visualisation

Now let's look at some of the attributes and statistics of the crime dataset.

We will start by looking at the top three crimes and a total count for each crime type:

```python
# What Crimes are the 3 most commonly occuring ones 
df[['primary_description', 'case']].groupby(
    ['primary_description'], as_index=False).count().sort_values(
    'case', ascending=False).head(3)
```

| primary_description | case  |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| THEFT               | 63629 |
| BATTERY             | 49498 |
| CRIMINAL DAMAGE     | 27980 |

To get a better understanding of the data we will now visualise it. The number of crimes per month, day and hour were calculated:

 ![image-20181001162714277](./cases_day.jpg)

![image-20181001162714277](./cases_hour.jpg)

Looking at the top three crimes it is clearly visible that the occurances of theft rise gretly during daylight hours and particularly between the hours of 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm.

![image-20181001162714277](./cases_hour_area.png)


Unsuprisingly there little obvious variation in the number of crimes committed per month other than an apparent drop-off in February. There is a small increase in crime reported at the weekend, Saturday and
Sunday, but nothing that couldbe considered significant. There is an expected fall-off in reported crime rates after midnight and before eight in the morning.

Finally the crimes data for a single month, August, was super-imposed over a map of Chicago to visualise the distribution of that data:

![image-20181001162714277](./markers.jpg)

The higher frequency of the top two crimes can be easily seen. Red for Theft and Blue for Battery.

Next the crimes were clustered:

![image-20181001162714277](./clusters.jpg)

Several obvious clusters of crime locations were visible, particularly in the center of Chicago.

Finally a heat map of the August crimes was created:

![image-20181001162714277](./heatmap.jpg)

This reinforces the cluster chart where it can clearly be seen that the center of Chicago and the area around Oak Park have a high crime rate occurrence. It will be interesting to see later if there is a high probability of crime in these areas if one of the top listed venues are located in these areas.
